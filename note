// functions that alters center thorugh center_i/r based on zoom value
// rough overview of the calculation:
// calculate the center of the cartezian plane (different from 
// what the pixel grid is), following that calculate the right border
// offset (max r) by adding the current center minus the center times 
// zoom. Your new right border position will have to be moved half that
// 0.1, the other half is move by the other border.
// does this even make sense?
