MandelBrot 
 ~ The simplest algorithm for generating a representation of the Mandelbrot set is known
  as the "escape time" algorithm. A repeating calculation is performed for each x, y point in the plot area and based on the behavior of that calculation, a color is chosen for that pixel. 
  ~ The result of each iteration is used as the starting values for the next.
  ~ each pixel goes through a number of iterations to dtetermine whether its in the set or out
